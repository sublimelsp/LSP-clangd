LSP-clangd
--------------------------------

## Installation
    - Install LSP and LSP-clangd from Package Control
    - Install clangd using your package manager or let this plugin install clangd for you

## Usage

By default, clangd will assume your code is built as clang some_file.cc, and youâ€™ll probably get errors about missing #included files, etc. 

For complex projects clangd needs to know your build flags. This can be done using a `compile_commands.json` or `compile_flags.txt` file.
